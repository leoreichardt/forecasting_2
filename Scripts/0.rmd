This report is intended to put into practice the knowledge gained in the Forecasting I course on M5 forecasting accuracy competition. Its goal is to understand the sales data of a Walmart store and compute different forecasting models. The most convincing result, an auto arima(5,1,0), allows us to give sales predictions as well as a 28-day prediction interval.

# Introduction

## Contexte and objectives

To achieve the most accurate predictions of sales over 28 days, we will first familiarize ourselves with the data in the exploratory data analysis part. We will try to understand the different patterns, identify possible trends and seasonalities. 
The data is hierarchical and is divided as follows: there are 10 stores located in 3 different states. We will focus our predictions on the store TX1. Each store is divided into 3 categories, and each of these categories is still composed of different departments. 
We will try several methods to see what gives us the best results. 


First, we will make a hierarchical analysis of the data using different techniques (arima and ETS) and approach (bottom-up, top-down and comb).  
Secondly, we will try to analyze only the store we are interested in, TX1, ignoring the hierarchy. 

Once all these possibilities have been tested, we will select the best model according to certain criteria explained below, and make the predictions for 28 days.  


## Data Division

To evaluate our different models, we have divided our data into 3 parts. Historical data is provided from 2011-01-29 to 2016-06-19, but a part of it contains only NAs. 
We took all the days without NAs, from which we removed 28 days for the validation set and 28 days for the test set. Remaining days are used to train our models. The figure above summarizes our split.
