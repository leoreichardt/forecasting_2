# Next we have to create a way of denoting which series is nested in another.

splitted <- do.call(rbind, stri_split_fixed(df$id, '_'))[,1:5]
# 2) Normalise the category names

## ARIMA without hierarchical decomposition


We observed in the Exploratory Data Analysis that the data presents several seasonalities. Thus, we made several attempts to take all of them into account. For example, we made the differentiations (single and double) “manually” before fitting a model. However, we were unable to undiff the forecasted data to get the true values. You can find these tests in the appendix.

In the next section, we will work only on the top level (TX1).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#take only level 0
train_set <- training_set %>% aggts(levels=0)
val_set <- validation_set %>% aggts(levels=0)
```


### Auto.arima without prior transformation

To start, we simply apply the auto.arima function to make an Arima automatically without any prior transformation. The approximation and stepwise parameters are set to “FALSE”. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#auto.arima sans tranformation préalable + forecast
model_auto <- train_set %>% auto.arima(approximation = FALSE, stepwise = FALSE)
checkresiduals(model_auto)
```
The result is an ARIMA(5,1,0). Residues seems to be normally distributed and centered around zero but we can see that there is still some dependency.

Indeed, on the top graph, we can clearly see the pattern linked to the closing of the store at Christmas. On the ACF, on the other hand, we note that there is still a weekly seasonality. These remarks are confirmed by the result of the Ljung-box test which gives us a value less than 0.05. Therefore, we can’t reject the null hypothesis that the time series isn’t autocorrelated.

We then carry out a forecast for the next 28 days and calculate the accuracy using the validation set (which corresponds to the same period). We get those metrics:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#forecast
fc <- model_auto %>% forecast(h=28)
fc <- data.frame(fc)
fc <- ts(fc)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Metrics
acc <- accuracy(fc, val_set)
kableExtra::kable(acc,
    caption = "<center><strong>28 days forcecast accuracy metrics</strong></center>",
    escape = FALSE,
    format = "html")%>%
    kableExtra::kable_styling(
        bootstrap_options = c("striped","bordered"),
        full_width = F)
```

We find a RMSE of 499.9. While testing, we made differentiations “manually” and got lower metrics which is a sign of a better model. However, we made the choice not to display them here (but in the appendix) because we were not able to undiff the forecasted values.

Below, you can find the table and the corresponding plot with the predicted values as well as the confidence interval.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#table
valsettable <- val_set %>% as_data_frame()
fctable <- fc %>% as_data_frame() 
newtable <- cbind(valsettable, fctable) %>% select(-c(3:4)) %>% rename("Observations" = "Total")

newtable %>%
  kable(caption = "<center><strong>28 days forcecast</strong></center>",
    escape = FALSE,
    format = "html") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F) 
```


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#plot
 autoplot(val_set) +
  autolayer(fc, lty=2) +
   theme_bw() +
   labs(title = "Observations & Predictions",
        subtitle = "With confidence interval",
        y = "Sales") +
       theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
