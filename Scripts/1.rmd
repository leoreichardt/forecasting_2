# Exploratory Data Analysis


## Overview of the situation

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
df$Sales_per_product <- df %>% select(7:1919) %>% mutate() %>% rowSums()

u <- df %>%
  group_by(state_id) %>%
  mutate(sales_state = sum(Sales_per_product, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(total_sales = sum(Sales_per_product)) %>%
  mutate(pour_sales_state = sales_state/total_sales)

u %>% 
  distinct(state_id, pour_sales_state) %>%  
  ggplot() +
  geom_col( aes(state_id, pour_sales_state, fill = state_id)) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "State ID", y = "",
       title = "Repartition of sales between state") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(legend.position = "None") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#69b3a2","steelblue3", "#69b3a2")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy=1), name = "Proportion") +
       theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))

remove(u)
```

CA accounts for more than 40% of the sales in the country, while TX stores are slightly under 30%. 


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}

i <- df %>%
  group_by(store_id) %>%
  mutate(sales_store = sum(Sales_per_product, na.rm = T))

i %>% 
  distinct(store_id, sales_store) %>%  
  ggplot() +
  geom_col( aes(store_id, sales_store, fill = store_id)) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Store ID", 
       y = "Number of sales",
       title = "Total sales by store") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(legend.position = "None") +
  scale_fill_manual(values =c("#69b3a2", "#69b3a2", "#69b3a2",  "#69b3a2","steelblue3", "#69b3a2", "#69b3a2", "#69b3a2", "#69b3a2", "#69b3a2")) +
       theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))

#remove(i)#69b3a2", "#404080"
```

The two stores with the most sales are in CA, which is not surprising given the previous plot. Our store, TX_1 is average-low in terms of sales. 

Now, let's focus on TX_1.

## Sales in TX1

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
TXdf$Sales_per_product <- TXdf %>% select(7:1919) %>% mutate() %>% rowSums()

w <- TXdf%>%
  group_by(cat_id)%>%
  mutate(sum_sales = sum(Sales_per_product)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(total_sales = sum(Sales_per_product)) %>%
  mutate(sales_cat = sum_sales/total_sales)

w %>%
  distinct(cat_id, sales_cat) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col( aes(cat_id, sales_cat), fill = "steelblue3") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Category ID", 
       y = "", 
       title = "Repartition of sales between categories") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(legend.position = "None") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy=1), name = "Proportion") +
       theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))

remove(w)
```

Food accounts for the vast majority of sales with more than 60%, followed by household. Hobbies represent less than 10% of sales.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
q <- TXdf%>%
  group_by(dept_id)%>%
  mutate(sum_sales = sum(Sales_per_product)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(total_sales = sum(Sales_per_product)) %>%
  mutate(sales_dept = sum_sales/total_sales)

q %>%
  distinct(dept_id, sales_dept) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col( aes(dept_id, sales_dept), fill = "steelblue3") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Departement ID", y = "",
       title = "Repartition of sales between departements") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(legend.position = "None") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy=1), name = "Proportion") +
       theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))

remove(q)
```

Not surprisingly, one of the food departments accounts for nearly half of the total sales in the store, followed by Household_1.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
tdf3$Sales_per_day <- tdf3 %>% select(15:3063) %>% mutate() %>% rowSums()

e <- tdf3 %>%
  group_by(weekday) %>%
  mutate(sales_weekday = median(Sales_per_day, na.rm = T)) 

e <- e %>% distinct(weekday, sales_weekday) 

e$weekday <- ordered(e$weekday, levels=c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", 
"Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))

ggplot(e) +
  geom_col(aes(weekday, sales_weekday), fill = "steelblue3") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Weekday", y = "Median sales", size = 10)+labs(title = "Median sales per weekday") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(legend.position = "None") +
       theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))

remove(e)
```

Sales are higher during weekends.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

t <-tdf3 %>%
  group_by(month, year) %>%
  mutate(sales_season = median(Sales_per_day, na.rm = T)) %>%
  distinct(month, year, sales_season)

t <- t %>%
  ungroup()

t.ts <- ts(t, start = c(2011, 1), end = c(2016,6), frequency = 12)

t.ts <- t.ts[,c(3)]

ggseasonplot(t.ts) + 
  labs(title = "Seasonplot of sales", y = "Sales") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold")) 


remove(t)
```


All years appear to be similar in terms of average sales, although there are variations between years. There are common points to all years, such as lower median sales in January, a peak around August and a drop between October and November. 
Note that not all the products were on sale from January 2011, which is probably why 2011 is lower. 

## Price evolution

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
prices_TX1 <- prices_TX1 %>% dplyr::filter(prices_TX1$store_id == "TX_1")


prices_TX1 %>%
  mutate(category = substr(item_id, 1, 5)) %>%
  group_by(category, wm_yr_wk) %>%
  mutate(avg_price = mean(sell_price)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(wm_yr_wk, avg_price, color = category)) +
    theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Evolution of prices, by category",
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Average price") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = seq(2011,2016,1)) +
       theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))
  
```

Prices appear to be linear with small variation over time. We cannot identify any particular trend. Average prices are lower in the beginning, but this is probably due to the fact that not all products were sold from 2011. 


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
#price evolution for one product in particular
prices %>%
  select(wm_yr_wk, PRICE_FOODS_3_794) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(wm_yr_wk, PRICE_FOODS_3_794)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Year", 
       y = "Price",
       title = "FOODS_3_794") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = seq(2011,2016,1)) +
       theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))
```

We have selected product "FOODS_3_794 to show the possible price variations over time. The three downward peaks are probably discounts.


## Events

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
events <- cal[!is.na(cal$event_type_1), ]   

events %>%
  count(event_type_1) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(event_type_1, n), fill = "steelblue3") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = c(10,20,30,40,50)) +
  labs(x = "Event type", y = "Number of events", title = "Repartition of events by type ?") +
       theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))

```

Most events are national or religious. It would be interesting to know what events happend during the 28 days that we have to predict. 

### Historical events within the 28-day prediction period

The only events that took place during this 28-days period in previous years are: "NBA Finals", "Independence day", "Ramadan start" and "Father's day". Looking at the date of these events in 2016, only "Independence day" takes place within this 28-days window. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
lm(Sales_per_day~event_name_1 == "IndependenceDay", tdf3) %>%
  broom::tidy()%>%
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```
The linear regression of independence day on sales shows that it does not have a significant impact. However, it will be interesting to set it as a factor in the time series to see if it increases the accuracy of our predictions.
