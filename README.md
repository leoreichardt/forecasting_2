Since we cannot upload the data on Moodle (large volume), here is how to reproduce our results.

1. Download the data: https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy/data
2. Put the data in the "Data" folder
3. Change all paths where necessary 

Ex: df <- read.csv('~/your_path/Data/sales_train_validation.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
